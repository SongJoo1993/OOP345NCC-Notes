# OOP345NCC Notes
## Workshop Zero
As a student in my class, you are to start your semester by familiarizing yourself with GitHub so you can share your daily work with me for advice/help, collaboration and monitoring your progress. 

This is done using what I call Workshop Zero; through a series of videos instructing you on how to set up your computer to use GitHub effectively for collaboration.
 
We will start this together in the first class (make sure you attend) but the detailed instructions of the workshop will be announced shortly.

Here are the Videos. The duedate for [Workshop Zero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxB4x6RkylouixUhNXf0MuwccLriA0DGC) is Monday Sep 12th.

### Mac Users and Workshop Zero
Workshop Zero is designed for windows, as you are required to learn and work with visual studio as an advanced IDE.<br />
For Mac, either you have to do all the git commands through command line, or you need to install a Virtual Machine and then do the lab:
- [Install Fusion Vmware](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html) Fusion is free for students; click on ["Register Lisence for Personal Use"](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal) 
- [Install Windows 10 on Fusion VM](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-custom-virtual-machine-vmware-fusion/)

# Workshop Zero
If you need help with your code you should have your computer setup and create a private GitHub repo and add me as a collaborator, [Follow the instructions of Workshop zero to get ready](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxB4x6RkylouixUhNXf0MuwccLriA0DGC).
